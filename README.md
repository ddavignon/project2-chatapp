## What is the theme you'll be using for Project 2?

 I went for a modern material design theme.

## How did you incorporate the theme into your project?

 I used the Materil-UI library for the majority of my components. I wanted to create something that was fun to look at, and I found a background of SF that I liked, so I incorporated that as well.

## What are known problems, if any, with your project?

 I am having trouble getting the chat list to load on the bottom without overflow. I think it is an issue with the Material-UI List components. No Google Sign In...

## How would you improve if you had more time?

 I would improve the UI of the chat list when a new message is entered. I would also add in Google Sign in. The user connected can be a little buggy testing with the same user across multiple browsers.
